# Module 7

# A simple Jira Clone
This project, I attempted to make a JavaFx clone of the popular task management software Jira. 
It ended up being significantly harder than expected.

# Running the software
To run, simply naviage to the "TaskManagerApplication.java" file and press the run arrow in IntelliJ.

# Shortcuts
The escape button shortcut is implemented, but the enter and delete short cuts are not yet implemented.
